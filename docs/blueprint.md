# **App Name**: Pass Prevue

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Allow users to upload a .pkpass file.
- File Parsing: Parse the .pkpass file to extract relevant information and assets (images, text, colors).
- Pass Preview: Display a preview of the pass, including its visual elements (logo, background, text fields) and relevant data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light periwinkle (#CCCCFF) for a clean, modern look that suggests clarity.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, for a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the pass content.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to highlight interactive elements without distracting from the pass preview.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern, slightly warm, sans-serif font for good readability.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for upload and settings, maintaining a clean aesthetic.
- Layout should focus on clearly presenting the previewed pass, with minimal distractions.
- Subtle animation for the loading and rendering of the pass content, and for hover interactions with buttons.
